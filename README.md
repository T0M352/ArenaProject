The game involves local competition between two players on a 2D arena, where they move in 4 directions. The main element of competition is combat. 
Each player has a specific amount of health points, which, when depleted, result in the loss of one "heart." Players also have a designated number 
of stamina points, which are consumed during attacks, evasions, and super abilities. Stamina points regenerate over time. The game ends when a player 
loses all 3 hearts or defeats the opponent. Players can perform a regular attack that pushes the opponent back and reduces their health points, use a 
unique ability specific to their class, or evade attacks. There are four different character classes: Knight, Mage, Thief, and Berserker. Each class 
has varying amounts of health points, stamina, basic attack style, and a super ability. The game features a special dungeon mode, where, if enabled, 
after a player loses one heart, they are transported to the dungeons. The dungeons consist of small mazes filled with enemies controlled by artificial 
intelligence. At the end of the dungeons, there is an arena where the fight continues until one of the players emerges victorious.
